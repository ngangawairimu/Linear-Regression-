## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of linear regression to predict target variables from structured data, focusing on identifying key factors that drive the predictions. The notebook provides a step-by-step approach, from data preparation to model evaluation, and emphasizes practical outcomes for data-driven decision-making.

### Key Outcomes
Predictive Insights: The linear regression model identifies and quantifies relationships between features and the target variable, enabling informed predictions and actionable insights.
Performance Metrics: Model performance is evaluated using key metrics such as:
R-squared: For goodness-of-fit, measuring variance explained by the model.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE): To assess prediction accuracy.
Feature Impact: Analysis of feature coefficients highlights the most influential variables, guiding focus on important predictors for further optimization or intervention

### Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 
Libraries:
pandas and numpy: Data handling and manipulation.
matplotlib and seaborn: Visualization of data trends and feature relationships.
